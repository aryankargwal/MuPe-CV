## Abstract

Recently CNNs have become prevalent in garnering attention among students, developers and companies, due to their high predictive potential in various computer vision tasks, all the while dealing with high dimensional data involving thousands of classes. The idea of CNN, however, stems from Multi-Layer Perceptrons, something that drives the upcoming research work. <br>

In this context, we propose a comprehensive study of how MLP compares to modern CNN architectures in context to upcoming Computer Vision tasks that are the need of the hour. We provide the MLP of choice with an optimized network configuration and run it against a CNN architecture with similar variable and computational footing, giving accurate factors of the standings in Computer Vision tasks, namely Classification, Segmentation, and Detection. <Br>

The main motive behind this study is to explore networks with smaller footprints that can potentially achieve similar or slightly reduced accuracies to dense CNNs. This improves training, testing, and iteration time allows deployment of ML algorithms in IoT Devices to further ML on Edge development, lets these advanced architectures be used in parallel with computationally heavy tasks such as Virtual Reality or WebApp Development. <br>
